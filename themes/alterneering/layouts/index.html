                <span class="highlight">Alterneering Studios</span> is a speculative design studio that 
                engineers alternatives by bringing them to life. We do this by 
                creating realities with their own logic, norms, characters 
                and stories. Within these, we design user-led artefacts with 
                the tools and technologies available to us today. With these 
                artefacts, we aim to create moments of doubt to influence the 
                perception of existing products, services and systems.

                Founded by <span class="highlight">Nicole Stoll</span>, <span class="highlight">Luca Milan</span> and <span class="highlight">Miles Mayr</span>, we 
                combine our different backgrounds in the field of 
                human-centred design to explore future possibilities.

            <p>
                We are currently working on a speculative design 
                playbook for <span class="highlight">workshops</span>   using a mix of original and 
                established tools and methods to develop new ideas 
                and concepts. To kickstart into an alternative reality, 
                we are designing a digital tool to create randomized 
                design challenges.

                We strongly believe in collaboration, and we are constantly 
                elaborating our playbook by talking, interacting and playing 
                with various groups.
